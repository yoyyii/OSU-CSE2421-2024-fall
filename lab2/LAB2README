One thing that troubles me was to figure out what data type should I be using. I was conflicting between whether to use  an int or a char for some of the variables (especially curr_hex) at the beginning, but int turned out to work better, so I chose to use that. Another thing was that my brain had a hard time wrapping around the idea of same number, different interpretation." For example, when writing the decrypting code for hex value, I had a hard time understanding  how I'm getting in this hex value but doing binary operation (shifting bits) on it.

(4 digit value: 1010)

(before read and process the 4 digit key)
gdb command: p /x key
key value: 0x0

(after read and procecssed the first digit of the key)
gdb command: p /t key
key value: 1000 0000

(after read and processed the second digit of the key)
gdb command: p /t key
key value: 1000 0000

(after read and processed the third digit of the key)
gdb command: p /t key
key value: 1010 0000

(after read and processed the fourth digit of the key)
gdb command: p /t key
key value: 1010 0000

(after line return key | (key >> 4) )
gdb command: p /t key_8_bits
key value: 1010 1010

I didn't run gdb on bit_decode2, since it produce the correct result when I execute it normally.
